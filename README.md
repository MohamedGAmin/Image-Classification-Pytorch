# Image-Classification-Pytorch

## Objective: 

Through this notebook, we will practice building, evaluating, and finetuning a convolutional neural network on an image dataset from development to testing.

## Setup and resources:

Having a GPU will speed up the training process

This notebook will use a subset of images from Tiny ImageNet, which is a subset of the ImageNet dataset [https://image-net.org/]. Our subset of Tiny ImageNet contains 30 different categories, we will refer to it as TinyImageNet30. The training set has 450 resized images (64x64 pixels) for each category (13,500 images in total).
